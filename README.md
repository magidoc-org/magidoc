<h2 align="center">Fast and highly customizable GraphQL documentation generator </h2>

----

Magidoc is an open source tool built from scratch that improves developer experience, provides more useful documentation and is more customizable than existing solutions.

It can generate static documentation from a GraphQL endpoint using the introspection query or SDL files and it offers advanced markdown support for the [SDL comments](https://dgraph.io/docs/graphql/schema/documentation/) and the custom pages.

## Features

- 🏁 **Simple** - Build your first website in seconds.

- ✏️ **Customizable** - Use pre-defined customizations or pick a template and make it your own.

- 🔥 **Live hot-reload** - Magidoc offers a [dev command](/cli/command-dev) that updates your website in real time when you write your documentation.

- 📝 **Markdown support** - Markdown is supported everywhere, from the custom pages and sections you can create, to the [SDL comments](https://dgraph.io/docs/graphql/schema/documentation/) inside your schema.

- 📦 **Fully typed** - Every plugin and template ships with TypeScript definitions out of the box.
