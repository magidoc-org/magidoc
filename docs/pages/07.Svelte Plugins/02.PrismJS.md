# PrismJS

:::tags

:::

A simple Svelte plugin built with TypeScript to display code inside the browser, using [PrismJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prismjs).

## Install

PrismJS is required as a peer dependency so you can use the themes and languages provided.

```shell
pnpm install -D @magidoc/plugin-svelte-prismjs prismjs @types/prismjs
```
## Basic Usage

The plugin exposes attributes to provide the source and the language. Attributes to display line numbers and a copy button are also available.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import Prism from '@magidoc/plugin-svelte-prismjs'
</script>

<Prism
  language={'javascript'}
  source={`
    const x = 'best plugin ever'
    console.log(x)
  `}
  showLineNumbers
  showCopyButton
/>
```

## Install languages

PrismJS supports a [ton of languages](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages) out of the box. You can use any of these languages simply by importing the syntax highlighting. Languages install themselves automatically, but PrismJS must be imported first.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import Prism from '@magidoc/plugin-svelte-prismjs'
  import 'prismjs/components/prism-graphql'
  import 'prism-svelte' // https://github.com/pngwn/prism-svelte
</script>
```

## Themes

You can modify Prism code sections style simply by importing a stylesheet. PrismJS provides many [themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/tree/master/themes) out of the box that you can easily import. Otherwise, there is a wide variety of themes available on the web and even a [theme generator](https://k88hudson.github.io/syntax-highlighting-theme-generator/www/).

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import Prism from '@magidoc/plugin-svelte-prismjs'
  import 'prismjs/themes/prism-dark.css'
</script>
```

:::notification type="info"
This website uses the PrismJS plugin to display code. If you like the theme used, it is a slightly modified version of the OneDark theme and is available [here](https://github.com/magidoc-org/magidoc/blob/main/packages/starters/carbon-multi-page/src/prism-theme.css).
