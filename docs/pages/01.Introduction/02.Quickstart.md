# Quickstart

> Before you begin, make sure that you have **Node 18+** installed. Lower versions are not supported.

## 1. Configuration file

The first thing to do is to create a Magidoc configuration file. Here is a minimal `magidoc.mjs` example.

```javascript
// magidoc.mjs

export default {
  introspection: {
    type: 'url',
    url: 'https://graphiql-test.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/schema-demo',
  },
  website: {
    template: 'carbon-multi-page',
  },
}
```

For the full reference, see the dedicated [Magidoc Configuration](/cli/magidoc-configuration) page.

## 2. Generate
```shell
pnpm add --global @magidoc/cli@latest && magidoc generate
```

For more details on how to use the `generate` command, see the [related documentation](/cli/command-generate).

## 3. That's it!

The built static website outputs in the `./docs` folder by default. To preview the website locally, run the following command.

```shell
magidoc preview
```
