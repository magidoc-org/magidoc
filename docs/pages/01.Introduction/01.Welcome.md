# Welcome

Welcome to **Magidoc**! Magidoc a is a free open source static documentation website generator for GraphQL. It aims to provide a vast variety of templates and plugins, giving you access to a large range of customization options to fit your needs.

## Why Magidoc?

In the GraphQL world, there are online web IDEs to play with GraphQL schemas. Namely, tools like [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) are great for developers to play with your API. However, even though some documentation is available in these tools, it is not easily searchable, discoverability is difficult, and most of all, it lacks of a way to present concepts, workflows, authentication mechanisms and examples.

Magidoc helps you achieve this with minimal effort. Either choose between one of the [provided base templates](/templates/introduction) with limited customization options, or generate a [starter project](/cli/command-eject) and customize it however you want.
