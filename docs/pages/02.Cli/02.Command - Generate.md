# Command - Generate

The `generate` command builds a static website using the `magidoc.mjs` configuration file as input. Use the `--help` option to discover more about the optional parameters you can use.

```shell
magidoc generate --help
```

Once your website is built successfully, the output can be previewed locally using the `preview` command. This command also uses the `magidoc.mjs` file.

```shell
magidoc preview --help
```
