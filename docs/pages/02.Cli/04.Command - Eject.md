# Command - Init

In case the available customizations are not sufficient for your needs, it is possible to initialize a starter project using any of the [available templates](/templates/introduction) and customize it however you want.

:::notification type="info"
If your customization needs are small and could be useful to other users, you are welcome to open an issue or contribute to add the customization to the template instead.
:::

:::notification type="warning"
If you decide to go on with the init command, you will no longer benefit from the template updates of Magidoc. You will need to keep the plugins and libraries up to date by yourself.
:::

To see all the available options for the `init` command, run the following.

```shell-session
$ magidoc init --help
```

When initializing a template, you may choose one of the [Magidoc templates](/templates/introduction). You also have the option to choose a package manager. The recommended default package manager is [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/workspaces).

## Magidoc configuration

When using the init command, you can decide to either drop completely Magidoc and use the template by itself, but Magidoc can also work with your template directory. Simply change the `website.template` property to the directory path to your template project.

```javascript
// magidoc.mjs

export default {
  website: {
    template: './docs',
  },
}
```
