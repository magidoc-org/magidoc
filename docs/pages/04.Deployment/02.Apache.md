# Deployment - Apache

[Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/) is one of the most popular implementation of HTTP server across the web. Deployment of static websites is natural on Apache, but there is a small configuration required to make it work well.

## Folder structure

Put the Magidoc output content inside your HTML directory on your server, typically `/var/www/html`.

Be careful not to forget anything, otherwise your website will not work.

```
/var/www/html
├── _app
│   └── ...
├── introduction
│   └── welcome.html
├── ...
└── index.html
```

If you want your website to be hosted on a non-root URL (e.g. `/docs`), make sure to set the `siteRoot` option in the [magidoc configuration](/cli/magidoc-configuration).

## Apache Configuration

Since Magidoc uses clean URLs to work, you need to enable [MultiViews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp-WacMe7yA) inside your configuration. This allows pages to load even if the file extension is omitted (e.g. `/introduction` rather than `/introduction.html`).
