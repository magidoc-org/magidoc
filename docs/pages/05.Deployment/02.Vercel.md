# Deployment - Vercel

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions. It is a great option for deploying Magidoc websites.

## Magidoc configuration

In your Magidoc configuration file, you need to add a static assets folder.

```javascript
import path from 'path'

export default {
  website: {
    staticAssets: path.join(__dirname, 'assets'),
  },
}
```

## Static assets

Inside the static asset directory, add a `vercel.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
  "cleanUrls": true
}
```

Your directory structure should look like this.
```
assets
└── vercel.json
magidoc.mjs
```

Finally, run `magidoc generate`, and navigate to the output directory of Magidoc. From there, execute `vercel deploy` to deploy your website. There are other ways you can deploy Magidoc onto Vercel, but this is the simplest way.
