# Deployment - Others

Naturally, you can deploy Magidoc websites on any HTTP server provider you desire, not only on the ones listed before.

> If you want to help others get around deploying Magidoc websites, you are perfectly welcome to open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/magidoc-org/magidoc/pulls) to explain how to achieve it with other providers.

## Quick links

Here is a small list of example of where and how you can host static websites on different platforms:

- [Netlify](https://httpd.apache.org/)
- [Heroku](https://medium.com/@agavitalis/how-to-deploy-a-simple-static-html-website-on-heroku-492697238e48)
- [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html)

## Important things

1. When hosting a Magidoc website, you need to configure your http server to use the extension `html` by default if none is provided. This is because Magidoc uses clean URLs for its pages (e.g. `/introduction` instead of `/introduction.html`). Many providers have this configured by default, but not all of them.
2. When hosting a website on a non-root URL (e.g. `https://example.com/docs`), you need to specify the `siteRoot` property inside the [magidoc configuration](/cli/magidoc-configuration).
