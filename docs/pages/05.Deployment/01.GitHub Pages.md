# Deployment - GitHub Pages

Deploying on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) is very simple since magidoc generates static files by default.

> If you are looking for a concrete example, this website is built with Magidoc and hosted on GitHub pages with a custom domain name. See the setup [here](https://github.com/magidoc-org/magidoc/tree/main/docs).

## Magidoc configuration

First thing, you need to set up your magidoc configuration to work on your repository's deployed URL.

```javascript
import path from 'path'

export default {
  website: {
    // ...
    // We will need some mandatory static assets
    staticAssets: path.join(__dirname, 'assets'),
    options: {
      // You need to specify the base path of your github pages root
      // Example: `/magidoc`
      siteRoot: '/<user>/<repo>',
    },
    // ...
  },
}
```

## Static assets

Since GitHub tries to use Jekyll by default to render your website, we need to disable Jekyll. You can do this by creating an empty file named `.nojekyll` inside the `assets` folder.

```
assets
└── .nojekyll
magidoc.mjs
```

## siteRoot

If you are deploying this from a private repo in an organization, omit the `siteRoot` property altogether because it will be a URL along the lines of `https://random-string-hash.pages.github.io/queries/my-query`. 

If it is a public repo in an organization then it becomes `https://<organization>.github.io/my-repo/` and your `siteRoot` should be just be `/<repo>`.
