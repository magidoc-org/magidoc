# General documentation
Magidoc offers the possibility to generate documentation that is completely unrelated to a GraphQL API. You can use the same markdown engine and the same configuration files, with the only difference that you must specify `introspection.type = 'none'` inside your magidoc configuration.

Doing so will only generate plain HTML from your `custom pages`. 

This website is actually created using this technique. You can see a full example [here](https://github.com/magidoc-org/magidoc/tree/main/docs).
