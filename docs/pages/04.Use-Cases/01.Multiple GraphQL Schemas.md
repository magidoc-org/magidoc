# Multiple GraphQL Schemas
At the moment, Magidoc only supports generating documentation for a single GraphQL schema at the time. It is however possible to document multiple APIs at the same time and link them together. 

There is a simple example of this approach as well as the details of how it works available in the [example section](https://github.com/magidoc-org/magidoc/tree/main/packages/examples/multi-schema) of the Github repository.
