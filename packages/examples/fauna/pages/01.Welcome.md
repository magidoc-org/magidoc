# ðŸ‘‹ Hi

Welcome to [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/blog/try-faunadbs-graphql-api)'s GraphQL documentation
generated with [Magidoc](https://github.com/magidoc-org/magidoc), a free open source software designed to build customizable static GraphQL documentation websites with little effort.

You wonder how easy it was to build this website? Have a look at the [configuration file](https://github.com/magidoc-org/magidoc/blob/main/packages/examples/fauna/magidoc.mjs).
