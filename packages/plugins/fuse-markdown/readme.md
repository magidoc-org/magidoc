# Magidoc - Fuse Markdown

This plugin is designed to index Markdown into a [FuseJS](https://github.com/krisk/Fuse) engine. It does so by splitting every section (separated by a header) into different documents, and then index each of these documents separately. Doing so makes it possible to know which document is in which section, and to search for a specific section.

> This plugin can be used in any browser or node application.
