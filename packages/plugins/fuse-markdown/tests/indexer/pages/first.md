# First page

This is a sample page that contains some very important text.

It is meant to be used as a test page in a unit test, making sure that the indexer is working properly.

## How it works

First, I have to create a page with a lot of useless information in it. And I must make sure to use **Multiple markdown features** to test indexing as much as possible.

## Tables

First, let's try to index some tables

| First         | Second column  | Third column  |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| First content | Second content | Third content |

## Lists

Then, we are going to try index some lists

- This is the first item of our list
- And here is a second item
- And finally a third item.

## Rest

The rest of the features will be tested in the [second and last page](second.md)
