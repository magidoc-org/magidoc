# Magidoc - Fuse GraphQL

This library was created to index GraphQL schemas into a [FuseJS](https://github.com/krisk/Fuse) engine. It does so by indexing each query, mutation, subscription and type into a search engine. All descriptions are parsed with a markdown engine to extract only the relevant text out of it.

> This plugin can be used in any browser or node application.
