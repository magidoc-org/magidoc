# Magidoc - Svelte Marked

Svelte-Marked is a markdown parser that renders into Svelte components. It supports [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) out of the box (tables, lists, raw HTML, etc.).

Each component renderer can be overwritten to customize its style and [extensions](https://github.com/markedjs/marked-extension-template) can be registered to support a more advanced markdown syntax.

> This library can be used in any Svelte or SvelteKit application.
