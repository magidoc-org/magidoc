## 1. Create a configuration file

First thing to do is to create yourself a configuration file for Magidoc to build your website how you want. Here is the most minimal `magidoc.mjs` you can have.

```javascript
// magidoc.mjs

export default {
  introspection: {
    url: 'https://graphiql-test.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/schema-demo',
  },
  website: {
    template: 'carbon-multi-page',
  },
}
```

For the full reference, see the dedicated [Magidoc configuration](/cli/magidoc-configuration) page.

## 2. Run Magidoc Generate
```bash
npx @magidoc/cli generate
```
For more details on how to use the `generate` command, see the [related documentation](/cli/generate).
## 3. That's it!
The built static website should be output in the `./docs` folder. To preview the website locally, run the following command.

```bash
npx @magidoc/cli preview
```
