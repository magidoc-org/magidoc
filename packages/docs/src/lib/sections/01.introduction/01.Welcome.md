- üì¶ **Fully Typed** - Every plugin and template ships with TypeScript definitions out of the box.

## Why Magidoc?

In the GraphQL world, there are online web IDEs to play with GraphQL schemas. Namely, tools like [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) are great for developers to play with your API. However, even though some documentation is available in these tools, it is not easily searchable, discoverability is difficult, and most of all, it lacks of a way to present concepts, workflows and examples.

Magidoc helps you achieve this with minimal effort. Either choose between one of the provided base templates with limited customization options, or generate a starter project and customize it however you want using technologies you may (or may not üòà) already know, like [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (using [Svelte-Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)), and many others.
