# Welcome

Welcome to **Magidoc**! Magidoc a is a free open source code base that can help you build your static documentation website for GraphQL APIs or anything else (like this website).

## Preamble

Before we get started, it is important to understand that Magidoc is not a tool that will generate all your documentation website for you. Rather than that, it provides different [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) starters and a wide variety of plugins that will do the heavy lifting for you, so that you can focus on designing your website how you want and not on the heavy logic required to build useful GraphQL documentation.

## Why Magidoc?

Magidoc is the only tool out-there that can help you create an entirely customizable GraphQL documentation website easily. And you can do this using technologies you may (or may not 😈) already know, like [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (using [Svelte-Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)), and many others.
