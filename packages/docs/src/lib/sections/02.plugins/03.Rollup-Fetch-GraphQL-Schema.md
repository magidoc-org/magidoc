title: Rollup fetch GraphQL Schema
since: 1.0.0
tags: ['standalone', 'plugin', 'rollup', 'vite']
---

This rollup plugin fetches the GraphQL Schema required by Magidoc Plugins and to build your website documentation. It performs a full [GraphQL Introspection Query](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) and stores the result on the file-system. This approach keeps your documentation independent from the actual API.

> Info: This plugin is also compatible with [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/), which is used by SvelteKit

## Install

First, add the module to your project.

```bash
pnpm install -D @magidoc/rollup-plugin-fetch-gql-schema
```

Then, add the plugin to your `Rollup/ViteJS` configuration. Here is an example for a `svelte.config.js`.

```javascript
import fetchGraphQLSchema from '@magidoc/rollup-plugin-fetch-gql-schema'

export default {
  kit: {
    vite: {
      plugins: [
        fetchGraphQLSchema({
          url: 'https://your-api-url.com',
        }),
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

## Configuration

Configurations are available for the plugin to change the behavior of the introspection query. Here is the full configuration example and its default values.

```javascript
fetchGraphQLSchema({
    // This is mandatory. Put your API URL here.
    url: 'https://your-api-url.com',
    // The HTTP method to use for the introspection query.
    method: 'POST' ,
    // The HTTP headers to provide in the introspection query.
    // Mainly useful if your API requires authentication.
    headers: {},
    // The target path where to put the introspection query result.
    // This defaults to the src asset directory of SvelteKit, so that the asset can be imported directly.
    target: 'src/_schema.json',
})
```
