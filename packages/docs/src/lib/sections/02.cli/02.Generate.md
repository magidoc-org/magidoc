title: Command - Generate 
---
The generate command builds a static website using the `magidoc.mjs` configuration file as input. Available additional options can be listed with the following command. 

```bash
npx @magidoc/cli generate --help
```

When your website is built successfully, the output can be previewed locally using the `preview` command. This command also uses the `magidoc.mjs` file. 

```bash
npx @magidoc/cli preview --help
```
