```javascript
// magidoc.mjs

export default {
  introspection: {
    // The URL to your API. 
    url: 'https://your-graphql-api-url.com/graphql',
    // The HTTP Method to use. Defaults to POST.
    method: 'POST',
    // Optional headers to provide in the request
    headers: {
      // Since we use configuration as code, you can perform authentication in this file or use environment variables
      Authorization: 'Bearer xxx',
    },
  },
  website: {
    // The template to use for the website
    template: 'carbon-multi-page',
    // Options to use for the website. There options are passed to the templates through environment variable at build time. 
    // Some templates may not support every possible options. Make sure you check the documentation related to the starter of your choice to know which options are available.
