title: Command - Init 
---
In the case that the available customizations are not sufficient for your needs, it is possible initialize a starter project using any of the available templates, and customize it however you want. 

> Warning: If your customization needs are small and could be useful to other users, you can perfectly open an issue or a PR to add the wished customization to the template rather than using this option. If you decide to go on with the init command, you will no longer profit from the template updates of Magidoc. You will need to keep the plugins and libraries up to date by yourself.

To see all the available options for the `init command`, run the following.

```bash
npx @magidoc/cli init --help
```

Choice of template and package manager are available when initializing a project. The recommended default package manager is [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/workspaces).
